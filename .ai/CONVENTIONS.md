# Conventions

## Observed conventions

- Terraform environments live under `environments/<name>`; resource concerns in Kubernetes are separated into `network.tf`, `subnets.tf`, and `compute.tf`.
- Non-secret defaults are committed in `terraform.tfvars`; OCI identity, image OCID, Availability Domain, and SSH key are generated locally into ignored `private.auto.tfvars`.
- Scripts are Bash compatible and live in `scripts/`.

## Recommended conventions

- Use English for technical context when a project has mixed-language documentation; otherwise match the repository's predominant language.
- Keep files and resource names lowercase and descriptive; use the conventions already established by the adopted project.
- Prefer small, focused changes and document meaningful architectural choices in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Do not introduce cloud, IaC, Kubernetes, or CI/CD conventions until those technologies are actually present.
- Treat these recommendations as guidance, not historical decisions; replace them with observed project conventions as the repository evolves.

## Documentation

- Keep `AGENTS.md` short and route-oriented.
- Reference authoritative docs instead of copying them.
- Keep `TASKS.md` current-state only and `HANDOFF.md` operational, not a chat transcript.
- Treat `LEARNINGS.md` as a bounded, append-only buffer; promote durable learnings into `CONVENTIONS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, or `VALIDATION.md` instead of letting them accumulate.
- Keep tool-specific files as thin adapters that only route to `AGENTS.md`; record their paths in `.ai/ADAPTERS.md`.
- Keep the Resume block in `HANDOFF.md` current as a rolling checkpoint and honor the thresholds in `.ai/LIMITS.md`.

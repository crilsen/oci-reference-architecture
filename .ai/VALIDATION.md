# Validation

## Completion rule

Before completion, run all applicable project validations that are available and safe. Report each as **Validated**, **Partially validated**, or **Not validated**, with the reason for anything not run. Never claim validation that did not occur.

## Recommended checks when the technology exists

### Terraform / OpenTofu

1. Run formatting (`terraform fmt -recursive` or `tofu fmt`).
2. Run `validate`.
3. Run `tflint` when configured.
4. Run `plan` only when credentials/backend are available and the task permits it.

### Kubernetes / Helm

1. Validate YAML.
2. Run `helm lint` and `helm template` when applicable.
3. Use client-side `kubectl` dry-run or configured policy tools when safe.

### Scripts and applications

1. Run applicable formatters, syntax checks, linters, and tests.
2. Run `shellcheck` for shell scripts when available.
3. Report untested runtime assumptions.

No project-specific validation commands have been identified yet.

## Observed project commands

- `bash -n scripts/bootstrap-kubernetes-tfvars.sh`
- `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- `terraform -chdir=environments/kubernetes validate`
- `terraform -chdir=environments/kubernetes plan -lock=false`
